# Metis RAG System Fix Plan Checklist

## Identified Issues

- [x] **Document Hallucination**: System claims to have documents that don't exist
- [x] **Memory Loss**: System forgets user information from earlier in conversation
- [x] **Content Fabrication**: System generates text instead of admitting it doesn't have information
- [x] **Citation Misuse**: System uses citation markers [1] that don't correspond to actual documents
- [x] **Vector Store Query Issues**: Empty search results handling needs improvement

## Fix Implementation Checklist

### 1. Improve System Prompts
- [x] **Status**: Completed | **Effort**: Medium
  - Implement modified RAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT with stronger instructions for:
    - [x] Document hallucination prevention
    - [x] Memory retention
    - [x] Content fabrication prevention
    - [x] Citation misuse prevention
  - **Note**: Implemented an improved system prompt that balances honesty with helpfulness. The prompt:
    - Clearly distinguishes between document-based information and general knowledge
    - Provides varied ways to acknowledge limitations to reduce monotony
    - Offers to provide general knowledge with clear disclaimers after acknowledging limitations
    - Suggests alternative queries that might yield better results

### 2. Enhance "No Documents Found" Handling
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: Low
  - [ ] Modify context formatting for empty results
  - [ ] Add prominent notice when no documents are found
  - [ ] Improve messaging for insufficient context

### 3. Improve Vector Store Empty Results Handling
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: Medium
  - [ ] Enhance search method to provide clearer empty results
  - [ ] Add special result that clearly indicates no documents were found
  - [ ] Improve logging for empty search results

### 4. Add User Information Extraction
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: High
  - [ ] Implement mechanism to extract user information from conversation
  - [ ] Add patterns to identify user names
  - [ ] Include user information in context for response generation

### 5. Fix Citation Handling
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: Medium
  - [ ] Modify context formatting to only include citations when documents exist
  - [ ] Ensure empty results clear the sources list
  - [ ] Improve citation formatting in responses

### 6. Add Verification Step Before Response Generation
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: Low
  - [ ] Add check for sources before generating response
  - [ ] Add explicit instruction to not use citations when no sources are found
  - [ ] Improve logging for verification step

### 7. Improve Vector Store Stats Checking
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: Low
  - [ ] Enhance check for documents in vector store
  - [ ] Add prominent notice when knowledge base is empty
  - [ ] Skip retrieval process when no documents are available

### 8. Enhance Error Handling
- [ ] **Status**: Pending | **Effort**: Medium
  - [ ] Improve error handling in query method
  - [ ] Provide clear error messages in context
  - [ ] Ensure errors don't result in citation misuse

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Empty Vector Store Test**
  - [ ] Clear vector store
  - [ ] Submit query
  - [ ] Verify system clearly states no documents are available

- [ ] **No Relevant Documents Test**
  - [ ] Add unrelated documents to vector store
  - [ ] Submit query
  - [ ] Verify system states no relevant documents were found

- [ ] **User Information Test**
  - [ ] Start conversation with "My name is [Name]"
  - [ ] Ask follow-up question
  - [ ] Verify system remembers and uses name

- [ ] **Document Request Test**
  - [ ] Ask about non-existent document
  - [ ] Verify system states it doesn't have that document

- [ ] **Citation Test**
  - [ ] Add relevant documents to vector store
  - [ ] Submit query
  - [ ] Verify citations only included for actual documents

## Implementation Progress

- [ ] User information extraction (Pending)
- [ ] "No documents found" handling (Pending)
- [ ] Citation handling improvements (Pending)
- [ ] Verification step before response generation (Pending)
- [ ] Error handling enhancements (Pending)
- [ ] Testing of all changes (Pending)

## Results of Testing with Improved System Prompt

We've successfully tested the improved system prompt with the following results:

1. **Varied Acknowledgment of Limitations**: Instead of the monotonous "Based on the provided documents, I don't have information about X" response, the system now uses varied phrasing:
   - "I've searched the available documents but couldn't find information about..."
   - "The documents in my knowledge base don't contain information about..."

2. **Offers General Knowledge**: The system now offers to provide general knowledge when documents aren't available:
   - "However, I can provide some general information about this topic if you'd like."

3. **More Conversational Tone**: The responses feel more natural and helpful while still maintaining honesty about limitations.

4. **No Hallucination**: The system still correctly avoids hallucinating information when no documents are available.

These improvements significantly enhance the user experience while maintaining the integrity of the RAG system.
