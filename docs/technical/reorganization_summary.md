# Metis RAG Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Metis RAG project file structure that was completed on March 27, 2025. The goal was to improve the organization of files in the root directory by moving them to appropriate subdirectories based on their purpose.

## Files Remaining in Root Directory

The following files remain in the root directory as they are essential project files:
- .clinerules-code
- .dockerignore
- .env
- .gitignore
- README.md
- alembic.ini
- pyproject.toml
- repomix-output.txt
- requirements.txt

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Improved Navigation**: Files are now organized by purpose, making it easier to find what you're looking for.
2. **Better Maintainability**: Related files are grouped together, making maintenance and updates more straightforward.
3. **Cleaner Root Directory**: The root directory now contains only the most essential files, reducing clutter.
4. **Logical Grouping**: Files are grouped by their function and relationship to each other.
5. **Better Onboarding**: New developers can more quickly understand the project structure and find relevant files.

## Next Steps

1. Update any import paths or file references in code that may have been affected by the reorganization.
2. Update documentation to reference the new file locations.
3. Consider implementing similar organization for any new files added to the project in the future.
