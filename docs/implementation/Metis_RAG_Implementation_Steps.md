### Advanced Features
- ✅ Implemented multiple chunking strategies
  - Recursive chunking (default)
  - Token-based chunking
  - Markdown header chunking
- ✅ Added analytics and monitoring dashboard
- ✅ Optimized performance for large document collections
- ✅ Enhanced mobile experience

## Advanced Chunking Strategies

The document processor now supports multiple chunking strategies:

1. **Recursive Chunking**
   - Default strategy that recursively splits text by characters
   - Configurable chunk size and overlap

2. **Token-based Chunking**
   - Splits text based on token count rather than characters
   - Better for maintaining semantic meaning

3. **Markdown Header Chunking**
   - Splits markdown documents based on headers
   - Preserves document structure

## Analytics Dashboard

The analytics system tracks system usage and performance:

1. **Query Analytics**
   - Records query details (text, model, RAG usage)
   - Tracks response times and token counts
   - Monitors document usage

2. **System Statistics**
   - Tracks vector store performance
   - Monitors cache hit ratios
   - Provides overall system health metrics

## Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations improve performance with large document collections:

1. **Vector Store Caching**
   - In-memory cache for search results
   - Configurable TTL and size limits
   - Cache statistics tracking

2. **Metadata Filtering**
   - Pre-filtering before vector similarity calculation
   - Support for complex filter criteria
   - Optimized tag and folder filtering

## Mobile Experience

The mobile interface includes touch-friendly features:

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Optimized controls for touch
   - Improved layout for small screens
   - Better readability on mobile devices

2. **Touch Gestures**
   - Pull-to-refresh for document lists
   - Swipe actions for document management
   - Optimized for touch interactions

## Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework has been implemented to verify RAG functionality:

1. **RAG Retrieval Testing**
   - Automated test script for document processing
   - Test cases for different query types
   - Verification of source citations and relevance

2. **Document Processing Testing**
   - Tests for various document formats (PDF, TXT, CSV, MD)
   - Verification of chunking strategies
   - Metadata extraction validation

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time tracking
   - Relevance scoring
   - Success rate calculation
