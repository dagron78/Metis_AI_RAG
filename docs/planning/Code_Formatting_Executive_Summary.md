# Code Formatting Fix: Executive Summary

## Issue

We identified a rendering issue in the chat interface where code blocks were displaying with incorrect closing tags. For example:

```
```python
def example():
    return "Hello World"
```python  # <-- Incorrect closing tag
```

This was causing confusion and making code examples difficult to read and copy.

## Solution: Structured Outputs

We implemented a comprehensive solution using Ollama's structured outputs feature, which constrains the model's output to a specific format defined by a JSON schema.

### Key Components

1. **Structured Output Schema**: A Pydantic model that defines the structure for responses containing code blocks:
   ```python
   class FormattedResponse(BaseModel):
       text: str
       code_blocks: List[CodeBlock] = []
   ```

2. **System Prompt**: A specialized prompt that instructs the model to return responses in the structured format.

3. **Format Parameter**: For code-related queries, we pass the schema to the model using the `format` parameter:
   ```python
   model_parameters["format"] = FormattedResponse.model_json_schema()
   ```

4. **Response Processing**: Logic to process the structured responses and format them properly for display:
   ```python
   # Replace code block placeholders with properly formatted code blocks
   for i, code_block in enumerate(formatted_response.code_blocks):
       placeholder = f"{{CODE_BLOCK_{i}}}"
       formatted_block = f"```{code_block.language}\n{code_block.code}\n```"
       main_text = main_text.replace(placeholder, formatted_block)
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Robustness**: By constraining the model's output format, we ensure consistent code block formatting.
2. **Maintainability**: The solution is more maintainable than regex-based fixes that try to correct formatting after the fact.
3. **Improved User Experience**: Users receive properly formatted code blocks that are easier to read and use.

## Implementation

The implementation involved:
- Creating a new Pydantic model for structured outputs
- Updating the system prompts to include instructions for structured outputs
- Modifying the RAG engine to use the format parameter for code-related queries
- Enhancing the response processing to handle structured outputs
- Adding support for structured outputs in streaming responses

## Testing

We created a comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_structured_code_output.py` to verify all components work correctly.
