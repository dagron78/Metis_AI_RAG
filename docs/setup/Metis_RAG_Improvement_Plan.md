## Current Issues and Improvements (March 2025)

Based on recent testing, we've identified several issues that need to be addressed:

### 1. Streaming Text Formatting Issues
- [ ] Fix token-by-token streaming that causes incorrect word breaks (e.g., "St abil ization")
- [ ] Modify token processing to accumulate tokens until complete words are formed
- [ ] Update frontend JavaScript to properly handle streamed tokens
- [ ] Implement buffer that only renders complete words
- [ ] Add specific tests for streaming functionality

### 2. Multi-Document Synthesis
- [ ] Improve synthesis of information across multiple documents
- [ ] Update prompt templates in `app/rag/rag_engine.py` with better synthesis instructions
- [ ] Implement cross-document reference analysis
- [ ] Create metadata that links related concepts across documents
- [ ] Refine relevance scoring algorithm

### 3. File Handling Problems
- [ ] Fix directory permissions in `app/utils/file_utils.py`
- [ ] Implement robust path handling with absolute paths
- [ ] Add path validation and normalization
- [ ] Improve error handling for file operations
- [ ] Update test fixtures to properly set up and tear down test directories

### 4. Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Implement comprehensive input sanitization
- [ ] Add global error handlers for different exception types
- [ ] Create standardized error responses
- [ ] Expand test suite with more edge cases

### 5. Response Time Optimization
- [ ] Reduce average response time (currently ~9.8s)
- [ ] Implement caching layer for frequently accessed documents and queries
- [ ] Optimize vector store implementation
- [ ] Process multiple chunks in parallel where possible
- [ ] Review prompt design for efficiency

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 1 week)
- [ ] Fix streaming text formatting issues
- [ ] Address file handling problems
- [ ] Implement basic input sanitization

### Phase 2 (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Enhance prompt engineering for better multi-document synthesis
- [ ] Implement caching for performance improvement
- [ ] Expand edge case testing

### Phase 3 (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Implement cross-document reference analysis
- [ ] Optimize vector search algorithms
- [ ] Add parallel processing capabilities

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-modal RAG Support**
   - Support for image and audio content
   - Cross-modal retrieval

2. **Advanced LLM Integration**
   - Support for more LLM providers
   - Model fine-tuning capabilities

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - User authentication and access control
   - Document sharing and collaboration

4. **Integration Capabilities**
   - API for external application integration
   - Plugin system for extending functionality

5. **UI Enhancements**
   - Visual indicators for source documents in responses
   - Debug mode to show retrieval details
   - Improved relevance threshold controls

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Caching for frequently accessed documents
