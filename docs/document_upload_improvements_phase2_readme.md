#### Upload Summary

## Technical Implementation

The enhanced document upload interface is implemented using:

1. **CSS**: `document-upload-enhanced.css` - Contains all the styling for the enhanced interface
2. **JavaScript**: `document-upload-enhanced.js` - Implements the enhanced functionality
3. **HTML**: `documents_enhanced.html` - The template for the enhanced interface

The implementation follows a progressive enhancement approach, building on top of the existing document upload functionality while adding new features.

## Dark Mode Support

The enhanced interface fully supports dark mode, using the same color palette as the rest of the application. The interface automatically adapts to the user's theme preference.

## Browser Compatibility

The enhanced interface is compatible with all modern browsers:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13.1+
- Edge 80+
