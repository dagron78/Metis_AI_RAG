# Metis RAG Technical Demonstration

## What is Metis RAG?

Metis RAG is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation platform that combines conversational AI with document-based knowledge retrieval. It enables users to chat with large language models while providing relevant context from uploaded documents, enhancing response accuracy and factual grounding.

## Key Features

- **Document Intelligence**: Supports multiple file formats (PDF, TXT, CSV, MD) with advanced processing capabilities
- **Advanced RAG Engine**: Implements multiple chunking strategies (recursive, token-based, markdown header) for optimal document representation
- **Vector Database Integration**: Uses ChromaDB with optimized caching for efficient similarity search
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to Ollama for local LLM inference with enhanced prompt engineering
- **Document Management**: Provides tagging, organization, and folder hierarchy for documents
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks system usage, performance metrics, and document utilization
- **Responsive UI**: Features modern interface with light/dark mode and mobile optimization

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design and streaming response handling
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with modular component design
- **RAG Engine**: Custom implementation with document processor, vector store, and LLM integration
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with performance optimizations and caching
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite for quality, performance, and edge cases

## Advanced Chunking Strategies

Metis RAG implements three sophisticated chunking strategies to optimize document representation for different content types:

1. **Recursive Chunking** (Default)
   - Recursively splits text by characters with configurable chunk size and overlap
   - Maintains semantic coherence by respecting natural text boundaries
   - Optimal for general-purpose documents with varied content
   - Configurable parameters: chunk size (default: 500), chunk overlap (default: 50)

2. **Token-based Chunking**
   - Splits text based on token count rather than character count
   - Preserves semantic meaning by respecting token boundaries
   - Better suited for technical content where token-level precision matters
   - Avoids mid-word splits that can occur with character-based chunking
   - Optimizes for LLM context window utilization

3. **Markdown Header Chunking**
   - Intelligently splits markdown documents based on header structure
   - Preserves document hierarchy and organizational structure
   - Creates chunks that align with logical document sections
   - Maintains header context for improved retrieval relevance
   - Particularly effective for technical documentation and knowledge bases

The chunking strategy selection is automatically determined based on document type but can be manually overridden. This multi-strategy approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy by ensuring that document chunks maintain semantic coherence and structural integrity.

## Basic Operation

1. **Document Upload & Processing**:
   - Upload documents through the document management interface
   - Documents are processed through configurable chunking strategies
   - Text is embedded and stored in the vector database with metadata

2. **Chat Interaction**:
   - User sends a query through the chat interface
   - System retrieves relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity
   - Retrieved context is combined with the query in a prompt to the LLM
   - Response is generated with citations to source documents

3. **System Management**:
   - Monitor system performance through the analytics dashboard
   - Configure models and system parameters
   - View document usage statistics and query patterns

## Performance & Testing

- Comprehensive testing framework with quality, performance, and edge case tests
- Current response time averaging ~9.8s (optimization target: <3s)
- Support for up to 10,000 documents with efficient retrieval
- Automated test suite for RAG functionality verification
- Performance benchmarking for response time, throughput, and resource utilization

## Future Advances: Agentic RAG

The roadmap for Metis RAG includes significant advancements in Agentic RAG capabilities:

1. **Autonomous Information Gathering**
   - Self-directed exploration of document corpus beyond initial retrieval
   - Iterative search refinement based on information gaps
   - Multi-hop reasoning across document boundaries
   - Autonomous query decomposition and recomposition

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Integration with external tools and APIs for data enrichment
   - Ability to execute code for data analysis within responses
   - Database querying capabilities for structured data integration
   - Web search integration for supplementing internal knowledge

3. **Adaptive Retrieval**
   - Dynamic adjustment of retrieval parameters based on query complexity
   - Automatic chunking strategy selection based on document content
   - Self-tuning relevance thresholds based on feedback
   - Context-aware retrieval that considers conversation history

4. **Reasoning and Synthesis**
   - Enhanced multi-document synthesis with cross-reference analysis
   - Contradiction detection and resolution across documents
   - Temporal awareness for handling time-sensitive information
   - Uncertainty quantification in responses

5. **Feedback Loop Integration**
   - Learning from user interactions to improve retrieval
   - Automated fine-tuning of embeddings based on usage patterns
   - Continuous improvement of prompt templates
   - Self-evaluation of response quality

These Agentic RAG capabilities will transform Metis RAG from a passive retrieval system to an active knowledge assistant that can autonomously navigate complex information landscapes, reason across documents, and continuously improve its performance.

## Demonstration Points

1. **Document Upload**: Show support for multiple file types and processing options
2. **RAG in Action**: Demonstrate how responses incorporate document knowledge
3. **Source Citations**: Highlight how the system cites sources for factual claims
4. **Multiple Document Synthesis**: Show how the system combines information across documents
5. **Analytics**: Display system performance metrics and document utilization
6. **Testing**: Run the test script to demonstrate RAG retrieval verification

Metis RAG represents a significant advancement in combining local LLM capabilities with enterprise knowledge management, providing accurate, contextual responses grounded in organizational documents.
