# Login Form Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix

## Issue Description

The Metis RAG application was experiencing an issue with the login functionality due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. The CSP was blocking inline JavaScript in the login.html file, which prevented the JavaScript code from properly handling the form submission, storing the authentication token, and redirecting after login.

Specifically, the browser console showed errors like:

```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'".
```

This resulted in the login form submitting directly to the current URL (/login) instead of the API endpoint (/api/auth/token), causing a 405 Method Not Allowed error since the /login route only accepts GET requests.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the issue was:

1. The login form had inline JavaScript in the login.html file
2. The Content Security Policy (CSP) was configured to only allow scripts from the same origin ('self')
3. The CSP explicitly disallowed inline scripts for security reasons (preventing cross-site scripting - XSS)
4. When the JavaScript was blocked, the browser fell back to the default HTML form submission behavior

## Solution Implemented

The solution was to move the inline JavaScript to an external file to comply with the CSP:

1. Created a new external JavaScript file: `app/static/js/login_handler.js`
2. Moved all the login form handling code from the inline script to this external file
3. Updated the login.html template to include the external script instead of the inline one
4. Ensured the form had the correct action attribute pointing to the API endpoint

### Code Changes

1. Created `app/static/js/login_handler.js` with all the login form handling logic
2. Modified `app/templates/login.html` to:
   - Remove the inline script
   - Add a reference to the external script
   - Set the correct form action attribute

## Testing and Verification

The fix was tested by:

1. Opening the login page in a browser
2. Entering valid credentials
3. Submitting the form
4. Verifying successful login and redirection to the main page
5. Confirming the username was displayed in the UI

## Security Considerations

This fix improves security by:

1. Complying with Content Security Policy best practices
2. Reducing the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
3. Ensuring credentials are properly submitted via POST requests rather than potentially exposing them in URLs

## Lessons Learned

1. Always follow CSP best practices by avoiding inline scripts and styles
2. Use external JavaScript files for event handling and form submission logic
3. Ensure HTML forms have proper action attributes as a fallback if JavaScript fails
4. Check browser console for CSP violations when debugging authentication issues

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing nonce-based CSP for cases where inline scripts are necessary
2. Review other parts of the application for similar CSP violations
3. Add comprehensive CSP testing to the CI/CD pipeline
