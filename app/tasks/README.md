# Background Task System

The Background Task System enables Metis_RAG to perform resource-intensive operations asynchronously, improving responsiveness and scalability. This system manages task scheduling, prioritization, dependencies, and resource allocation.

## Key Components

### TaskManager

The TaskManager is the central component of the Background Task System. It manages the lifecycle of background tasks, including submission, execution, cancellation, and status tracking. It also provides concurrency control with configurable limits.

```python
from app.tasks.task_manager import TaskManager
from app.tasks.task_models import TaskPriority

# Create a task manager
task_manager = TaskManager(max_concurrent_tasks=10)

# Submit a task
task_id = await task_manager.submit(
    name="Process Document",
    task_type="document_processing",
    params={"document_id": "123"},
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH
)

# Get task status
task = task_manager.get_task(task_id)
print(f"Task status: {task.status}")

# Cancel a task
cancelled = await task_manager.cancel(task_id)
```

### ResourceMonitor

The ResourceMonitor tracks system resources (CPU, memory, disk, I/O) and provides adaptive throttling based on system load. It also generates alerts when resource usage exceeds configured thresholds.

```python
from app.tasks.resource_monitor import ResourceMonitor, ResourceThreshold

# Create a resource monitor with custom thresholds
resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor(
    thresholds=ResourceThreshold(
        cpu_percent=80.0,
        memory_percent=80.0,
        disk_percent=90.0,
        io_wait_percent=30.0
    )
)

# Get system load
load = resource_monitor.get_system_load()
print(f"System load: {load:.2f}")

# Get recommended concurrency
concurrency = resource_monitor.get_recommended_concurrency(max_concurrency=10)
print(f"Recommended concurrency: {concurrency}")
```

### Scheduler

The Scheduler handles task scheduling, prioritization, and dependencies. It ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order and at the appropriate time.

```python
from app.tasks.scheduler import Scheduler
from app.tasks.task_models import Task, TaskDependency

# Create a scheduler
scheduler = Scheduler(resource_monitor=resource_monitor)

# Create a task with dependencies
task = Task(
    name="Generate Report",
    task_type="report_generation",
    dependencies=[
        TaskDependency(task_id="123"),
        TaskDependency(task_id="456")
    ]
)

# Schedule the task
await scheduler.schedule_task(task)
```

## Task Models

The Background Task System uses the following models to represent tasks and their properties:

- **Task**: Represents a background task with properties like name, type, parameters, priority, dependencies, etc.
- **TaskStatus**: Enum representing the status of a task (PENDING, SCHEDULED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED, WAITING)
- **TaskPriority**: Enum representing the priority of a task (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **TaskDependency**: Represents a dependency between tasks

## API Endpoints

The Background Task System provides the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/tasks`: Create a new background task
- `GET /api/v1/tasks`: List background tasks with optional filtering
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`: Get a task by ID
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/cancel`: Cancel a task
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/stats`: Get task statistics

## Task Types

The Background Task System supports the following task types:

- `document_processing`: Process a document (chunking, embedding, etc.)
- `vector_store_update`: Update the vector store with new documents
- `report_generation`: Generate a report based on document analysis
- `data_export`: Export data to a file or external system
- `system_maintenance`: Perform system maintenance tasks (cleanup, optimization, etc.)

## Task Dependencies

Tasks can depend on other tasks, forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies. A task will only be executed when all its dependencies are satisfied.

```python
# Create a task with dependencies
task = Task(
    name="Generate Report",
    task_type="report_generation",
    dependencies=[
        TaskDependency(task_id="123", required_status=TaskStatus.COMPLETED),
        TaskDependency(task_id="456", required_status=TaskStatus.COMPLETED)
    ]
)
```

## Adaptive Scheduling

The Background Task System uses adaptive scheduling to optimize resource usage. It adjusts the number of concurrent tasks based on system load, ensuring that the system remains responsive even under heavy load.

## Resource Monitoring

The ResourceMonitor tracks the following system resources:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk usage
- I/O wait

When resource usage exceeds configured thresholds, the ResourceMonitor generates alerts and may throttle task execution to prevent system overload.

## Performance Considerations

- The Background Task System is designed to handle a large number of tasks efficiently.
- Tasks are prioritized based on their priority level and wait time.
- The system automatically adjusts concurrency based on system load.
- Long-running tasks should be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks when possible.
- Tasks with dependencies should be designed carefully to avoid deadlocks.

## Error Handling

The Background Task System provides robust error handling:

- Tasks can be configured with a maximum number of retries.
- Failed tasks are automatically retried with exponential backoff.
- Task errors are logged and can be viewed through the API.
- System-level errors (e.g., resource constraints) are handled gracefully.

## Monitoring and Dashboards

The Background Task System provides comprehensive monitoring and dashboards:

- Task statistics (pending, running, completed, failed, etc.)
- System resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, I/O)
- Resource alerts
- Task execution history

## Integration with Other Components

The Background Task System integrates with other components of Metis_RAG:

- Document processing
- Vector store updates
- Response quality evaluation
- System maintenance
