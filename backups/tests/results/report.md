Stabilium plays a critical role in facilitating quantum tunneling through non-Euclidean space-time manifolds. According to document [1], Stabilium maintains quantum states even when subjected to extreme conditions near space-time curvature anomalies. Furthermore, it provides topological protection to quantum information, preventing decoherence during tunneling events [1]. The material’s unique response to space-time curvature creates “tunneling-friendly” conditions at its boundaries [1]. Document [4] elaborates on this, stating that Stabilium enables quantum information to maintain fidelity above 92% during tunneling, significantly higher than conventional materials [4]. Essentially, Stabilium acts as a conduit for quantum particles to traverse these complex geometries while preserving their quantum properties [1, 4].
