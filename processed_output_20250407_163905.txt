Here's a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. The function takes an integer as input and returns its factorial. It includes error handling to ensure the input is a non-negative integer. ```python

python

def calculate_factorial(number):
 """Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

 Args:
 number(int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

 Returns:
 int: The factorial of the number.
 None: If the input is not a non-negative integer.
 """
 if not isinstance(number, int) or number < 0:
 print("Error: Input must be a non-negative integer. ")
 return None

 if number == 0:
 return 1
 else:
 factorial = 1
 for i in range(1, number + 1):
 factorial *= i
 return factorial

```
