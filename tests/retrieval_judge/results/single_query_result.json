(the text is cut off, but it seems to be related to processing documents)\n\nAccording to the context, these components work together as part of the RAG Engine within Metis RAG's modular architecture.\n\nNote that there might be more information about the Document Processing pipeline or other RAG engine components not included in the provided documents. However, based on the available context, this is all the information I can provide.",

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents [1], [2], and [3], the components of the RAG engine are:\n\n* Document Processing: The core RAG engine consists of a document processing pipeline that handles:\n\t+ File validation and parsing\n\t+ Text extraction\n\t[No further information is available in the context about how these components work together.]\n\nNote that there is no explicit information provided in the context about the specific interactions or processes between the different components of the RAG engine. However, based on the general architecture overview, it can be inferred that the RAG engine likely integrates with the frontend and API layers to facilitate document management, chat interactions, system configuration, and analytics data retrieval.\n\nSources:\n[1], [2], and [3]",
