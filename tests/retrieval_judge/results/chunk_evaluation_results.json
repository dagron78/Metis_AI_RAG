Chunk 2 is tangentially related, focusing on document processing. Chunk 3 is irrelevant. Chunk 4 is irrelevant. Chunk 5, however, directly addresses the question by describing the Retrieval Judge's role in enhancing the RAG retrieval process, which is a key aspect of how the system works.  Because the initial chunks are too detailed and don't answer the question at a high level, and because chunk 5 provides a more relevant explanation, the query needs refinement to focus on the overall architecture and operation of the RAG system."
