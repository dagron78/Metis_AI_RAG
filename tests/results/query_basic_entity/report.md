## Generated Answer
```
Stabilium is a revolutionary material with significant applications in quantum computing. According to document [1], Stabilium maintains quantum coherence for up to 500 microseconds, operates effectively at temperatures up to 28K, and has resonance modulation properties built into its molecular structure. Furthermore, document [2] details its use in quantum teleportation enhancement and accelerating quantum computing by facilitating quantum tunneling through non-Euclidean space-time regions. Document [3] highlights its role in quantum memory and integration with Quantum Resonance Modulation (QRM) techniques. Finally, document [4] describes its application in quantum sensing in curved space-time regions.
