Based on the provided documents, here’s a comparison of Stabilium QRM-12X with earlier versions: 

**Key Differences: **

* **Coherence Time: ** QRM-12X achieves coherence times exceeding 1 millisecond (currently in early development), significantly longer than the 300 microseconds of Standard Stabilium and QRM-8. 
* **Gate Operation Speed: ** QRM-12X has a gate operation speed of 20ns, faster than the 50ns of Standard Stabilium and 35ns of QRM-8. 
* **Power Consumption: ** QRM-12X consumes 45% of the baseline power, a reduction from the 100% of Standard Stabilium and 75% of QRM-8. 
* **Manufacturing Cost: ** The manufacturing cost of QRM-12X is 90% of the baseline, lower than the 100% of Standard Stabilium and 120% of QRM-8. 
* **Cooling Requirements: ** QRM-12X requires 60% of the baseline cooling requirements, less than the 100% of Standard Stabilium and 80% of QRM-8. 
* **Manufacturing Scale: ** QRM-12X can be manufactured in sheets up to 25cm², more than doubling the size capability of the original version.
