    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can provide a detailed overview of the architecture of Metis RAG.\n\nAccording to [1] Source: technical_documentation.md, Metis RAG follows a modular architecture with three main components:\n\n* Frontend Layer: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this layer provides an intuitive interface for document management, chat interactions, system configuration, and analytics and monitoring.\n* API Layer: Implemented using FastAPI, this layer provides endpoints for document upload and management, chat interactions, system configuration, and analytics data retrieval.\n* RAG Engine: The core engine consists of three sub-components:\n\t+ Document Processing: Handles file validation and parsing, text extraction, chunking with configurable strategies, and metadata extraction.\n\t+ Vector Store: Responsible for storing document embeddings, efficient similarity search, and metadata filtering.\n\t+ LLM Integration: Connects to Ollama for local LLM inference, manages prompt templates, and handles context window optimization.\n\nThese components work together to provide advanced RAG capabilities, such as multi-document retrieval, enterprise security, and other features mentioned in the product specifications (Source: [2] product_specifications.csv).\n\nPlease note that this answer is based primarily on the provided context, specifically [1] technical_documentation.md. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
