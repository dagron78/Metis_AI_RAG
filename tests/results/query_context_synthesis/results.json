  "answer": "Stabilium interacts with Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle in several ways, as demonstrated in quantum entanglement experiments. Specifically, Stabilium\u2019s ability to maintain quantum coherence for extended periods allows for more precise measurements within the bounds of the uncertainty principle [1]. Furthermore, Stabilium-based quantum sensors can approach the theoretical limits imposed by the uncertainty principle more closely than previous technologies [1]. Additionally, Stabilium can store entangled states as a quantum memory, preserving the entanglement properties while subject to the constraints of the uncertainty principle [1].\n\nSources: \n[1] Document ID: heisenberg_uncertainty_principle. md - \"Document Title\"",
