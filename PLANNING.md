- **Document Processing**: LangChain with custom chunking strategies
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with fetch API
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Testing**: Pytest, unittest

## Design Principles

1. **Accuracy First**: The system prioritizes factual accuracy and source attribution over generative capabilities.
2. **Explicit Memory**: The system maintains explicit memory of user information and conversation context.
3. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be modular and replaceable.
4. **Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling for increased load.
5. **Security**: Authentication and authorization are integrated at all levels.
6. **Performance**: Optimized for low latency responses and efficient resource usage.
7. **Transparency**: Clear source attribution and audit trails for all responses.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Chunking Strategy**
   - Intelligent document analysis for optimal chunking
   - Adaptive parameters based on document type and content
   - Preservation of semantic meaning and document structure

2. **Query Refinement and Retrieval Enhancement**
   - Query analysis and refinement for improved retrieval
   - Relevance evaluation of retrieved chunks
   - Re-ranking based on query relevance

3. **Response Quality Pipeline**
   - Response synthesis with proper source attribution
   - Factual accuracy verification
   - Hallucination detection and removal
   - Iterative refinement for quality improvement

4. **Conversation Memory**
   - Persistent memory across conversation turns
   - Explicit memory commands for information storage
   - Implicit memory retrieval for contextual awareness
   - Memory categorization and prioritization

5. **Multi-User Support**
   - User authentication and access control
   - Resource ownership and permission management
   - Isolated data and conversation contexts

## Constraints and Considerations

1. **Performance Constraints**
   - Response time targets: < 3 seconds for typical queries
   - Document processing time: < 30 seconds for standard documents
   - Memory usage: < 4GB RAM for core services

2. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Horizontal scaling for increased user load
   - Vector database partitioning for large document collections
   - Background task distribution for processing-intensive operations

3. **Security Requirements**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - CORS protection and security headers
   - Input validation and sanitization

4. **Deployment Requirements**
   - Docker containerization for all components
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Health checks and monitoring
   - Backup and recovery procedures
