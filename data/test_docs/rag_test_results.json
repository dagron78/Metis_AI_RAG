    "query": "What is the architecture of Metis RAG?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the architecture of Metis RAG can be summarized as follows:\n\nAccording to [1] and [2], Metis RAG has a modular architecture consisting of three main components: Frontend Layer, API Layer, and RAG Engine.\n\nThe Frontend Layer is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive interface for document management, chat interactions, system configuration, and analytics and monitoring. This is stated in both [1] and [2].\n\nThe API Layer is implemented using FastAPI and provides endpoints for document upload and management, chat interactions, system configuration, and analytics data retrieval. Again, this information is present in both [1] and [2].\n\nThe RAG Engine consists of three main parts: Document Processing, Vector Store, and LLM Integration.\n\nDocument Processing handles file validation and parsing, text extraction, chunking with configurable strategies, and metadata extraction, as described in [1] and [2].\n\nVector Store is responsible for storing document embeddings, efficient similarity search, and metadata filtering. This information can be found in both [1] and [2].\n\nLLM Integration connects to Ollama for local LLM inference, manages prompt templates, and handles context window optimization. This is also stated in both [1] and [2].\n\nNo additional information beyond what's provided in the context is necessary to answer this question.\n\nSources:\n[1] Source: technical_documentation.md, Tags: [], Folder: /test\n[2] Source: technical_documentation.md, Tags: [], Folder: /test",

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, it appears that there is no specific information regarding strategic initiatives for Q2 (Quarter 2). The context primarily discusses the potential and current state of Quantum Process Synchronization (QPS) research, emphasizing its developmental phase.\n\nWhile we don't have direct information about strategic initiatives for Q2, we can infer from the general tone and themes in the provided context that any strategic plans for this quarter would likely involve continued research, testing, and refinement of QPS-based technologies. The fact that investors and governments worldwide are showing strong interest in quantum research suggests that there may be ongoing efforts to accelerate the development of practical applications.\n\nHowever, without more specific information, it's difficult to provide concrete details about what these strategic initiatives might entail. If you're looking for guidance on potential strategic plans or initiatives related to QPS, I would suggest exploring other sources that provide more context or insights into the research and development landscape.",

    "query": "How does the vector store work?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, specifically [1] and [2], I can provide information about the Vector Store component of the Metis RAG system.\n\nAccording to the documentation, the Vector Store is responsible for:\n\n* Storing document embeddings\n* Efficient similarity search\n* Metadata filtering\n\nThis suggests that the Vector Store plays a crucial role in enabling efficient retrieval and comparison of documents within the Metis RAG system. The vector store likely uses techniques such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) or word embeddings to create dense representations of documents, allowing for fast and accurate matching between queries and relevant documents.\n\nHowever, I must note that the context does not provide detailed information on how the Vector Store component works in practice, such as specific algorithms used or parameters for tuning its performance. For more comprehensive understanding of this component's functionality, additional documentation or expert knowledge may be necessary.\n\nIn any case, based on the provided context, it appears that the Vector Store is designed to facilitate efficient and effective document retrieval within the Metis RAG system.",
